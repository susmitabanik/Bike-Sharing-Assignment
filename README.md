General Information 
A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state. 
In such an attempt, BoomBikes aspires to understand the demand for shared bikes among the people after this ongoing quarantine situation ends across the nation due to Covid-19. They have planned this to prepare themselves to cater to the people's needs once the situation gets better all around and stand out from other service providers and make huge profits.

Conclusion
Top 4 features affecting the demand are: Temperature, Weather situation, Year, Month
Recommendations to the company: The months - Jan , Jul , Sep , Nov , Dec should be considered as prime months due to the higher demands of bikes in these months. With an increase in temperature the demand also increases. Rainfall and snowfall are factors that lead to reduction of demand.
